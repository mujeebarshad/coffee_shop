A day at a coffee shop!

A customer visits a coffee shop that sells a bunch of items (e.g. beverages, sandwiches, etc.).

Items have varying tax rates and some are free or offered at a discount when ordered with another item.

The customer is made aware of the order total and once he pays for it, he can wait until notified of the order completion
